For a stylish oversized garment, order one or two sizes up. For a fitted style, it may be appropriate to size down. \\n\\nThis heavy blend fleece crew-neck sweatshirt is pure comfort. Made with a thick blend of cotton and polyester, it feels plush, soft and warm, a perfect choice for any cold day. The collar is ribbed knit, so it retains its shape even after washing.

To avoid issues, please refer to all provided info or reach out to me with questions. I am happy to help!\\n\\n\ud83d\udcebUnfortunately, we are not able to control shipping delays caused by ANY of the the holidays, or any other issues the USPS may be experiencing. However, if your item is delayed during the production process or becomes lost during delivery, we are happy to assist in resolving the issue so PLEASE REACH OUT TO US!\\n\\n\ud83d\udcf8Photos provided in the gallery are mocked up examples and for illustrative purposes only. The actual item may differ slightly from the photos so it is recommended that you refer to all size and color charts provided. Colors can appear different than the actual product due to individual computer screen settings and photo lighting differences. Additionally, the graphic may be scaled to appropriately fit the size of the garment.\\n\\n\u2139\ufe0fPrinting Info: Items are produced using Direct To Garment Printing -DTG, which sprays the ink directly on to the fabric. Because the fabric absorbs the ink, the colors may not appear as vivid as the mocked up photos. This process is different than screen or vinyl printing, and because of this process the items graphic is more durable and longer lasting. We do our best to provide the best possible depiction that we can. Also, in some cases we do provide fabric colors that are similar to the colors in the print because we like some shirts to have less contrast and to provide a kind of camouflaged or subtle effect (i.e., black print on dark grey fabric, you get the idea). If you choose one of the items with this effect, please be aware that the graphics will be less visible. Feel free to reach out to me with questions. I have ordered many samples for myself, and have personally viewed items purchased by friends and can honestly say that the graphics have turned out as expected.\\n\\n\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0fArtwork & Production:\\nAll of my products are Made-To-Order using print-on-demand providers: I use production partners across the U.S., Canada, and in some cases a country as close to the destination country as possible to print or embroider my one-of-a-kind designs onto the products I sell. These partners then ship the item directly to you for me which results in a faster delivery to my awesome customers.\ud83d\ude00\\n\\nMy original artwork and one-of-a-kind designs are created using a combination of my own ideas and research; artwork, clip art, edited AI generated graphics, and unique fonts. All of my designs are protected by copyright upon creation and any theft of said designs will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, and makes the thieves total losers who deserve bad karma for life\ud83e\udd14.\\n\\n\ud83d\udc9eI truly hope whatever you find here inspires adventure, shows the world your sassy side or makes you laugh, provides you with the perfect gift for someone in your life, ignites the warrior spirit within yourself or someone you care about. Ciao\ud83d\udc9e",
